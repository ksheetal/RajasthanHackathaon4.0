RAJASTHAN HACKATHON 4.0

AAAS : A MAJOR STEP TOWARDS A NEW BEGINNING
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INTRODUCTION:

About 0.75 million neonates die every year in India, the highest for any country in the world. Rajasthan notched up a decline in the infant mortality rate (IMR)  but in-depth analysis of data reveals some disturbing  facts as the IMR in Rajasthan is still as high as 41. 
With a maternal mortality ratio (MMR) of approximately 445 per 100,000 live births, the state of Rajasthan contributes significantly to India's burden of maternal deaths
To reduce child death rate, pregnant women and newborn babies should be taken good care. Nutritious food, regular health checkup for new mothers and vaccination, breastfeeding, proper food for newly born should be ensured.
Child mortality rates in Rajasthan could be significantly reduced if community health workers visited new mothers regularly. Adequate prenatal care is essential to ensuring infants are born at a healthy weight. During pregnancy, the mother’s health, environment, and experiences affect how her fetus develops and the course of the pregnancy. By taking good care of her own health before and during pregnancy, a mother can reduce her baby’s risk of many of the leading causes of infant mortality. 
Because of advances in medical science, your child can be protected against more diseases than ever before. Some diseases that once injured or killed thousands of children, have been eliminated completely and others are close to extinction– primarily due to safe and effective vaccines. Polio is one example of the great impact that vaccines had have. Immunizations can save your child’s life. Vaccines have reduced and, in some cases, eliminated many diseases that killed or severely disabled people just a few generations ago. Thus, it is necessary to get your child vaccinated at the correct time. 

To overcome all these challenges and to bring down the infant mortality rate, it is necessary to monitor the health of both, mother and  child. Timely check-ups, following a proper diet chart , vaccination for the newborns, are all important steps that need to be taken in this direction. Our app provides a platform that will perform all these functionalities.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:

Rajasthan has fairly high child death rate and health of pregnant women and infants is often neglected. The first challenge is the lack of awareness among common people. Besides, there are some other problems, which include not taking proper care of pregnant women, avoiding vaccination of the newly born infant etc. The biggest challenge is to reduce neonatal deaths, that is, infant deaths that occur within the first 28 days of life. One of the major reasons that has not let government curb this problem is the deteriorating nutritional status. Poor nutrition can also lead to stunted growth and impaired cognitive ability. Prematurity, pneumonia, complications during labor and delivery, diarrhea, sepsis and malaria are other leading causes of death for children under five years old. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROPOSED SOLUTION:

Having a baby is one of the most wonderful things in your life, as well as the hardest thing in one’s life. To face the mentioned challenges and bring down the infant mortality rate, it is necessary to monitor the health of both, mother and child.
Our main idea is to develop an android application which acts as personal assistant for a mother. It will provide details of diet charts to be followed during pregnancy, vaccinations to be taken by the newborn baby. The proposed system will allow the users to monitor the timely check-ups, proper diet charts, vaccinations that are already taken by the child and generate notifications for upcoming vaccinations and health check-ups. To reach out to a wider audience, our app will also provide volunteers to help those who are unable to use our app. 

Our application will provide a platform that will perform all these functionalities.
